            "\n",
            "First, I need to determine the business category. Hullett Block is a location, but I'm not sure what kind of business it is. The review mentions a biometric scan, which makes me think it might be a healthcare or wellness facility, maybe a clinic or a sleep center. But without more context, I might have to infer based on the keywords.\n",

But the sarcastic tone might make it a satire. However, the user didn't mention any specific promotional content. \n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, the user's instruction says to check if the review is relevant to the business category. If Hullett Block is a healthcare facility, then the review is relevant.

But in this case, the review is positive in rating but the content is negative. Wait, the user says \"rating does not match sentiment (e.g., 5 stars but 'awful service').\" So if the review is positive in rating but the text is negative, that's a mismatch. But here, the text is sarcastic, so maybe the sentiment is negative, but the rating is 5. That would be a mismatch, so Spam. \n",
            "\n",
            "Alternatively, maybe the user is being sarcastic and the actual sentiment is positive. But the way it's written, \"wonderful waking up at 10 for biometric scan\" is sarcastic, implying that waking up late for a scan is a bad thing. So the sentiment is negative, but the rating is 5 stars. That's a mismatch, so Spam. \n",

That's a specific address, so I should check what kind of business is there. Maybe it's a retail store, a service center, or something else. But since I don't have external data, I'll have to make an educated guess. Toa Payoh is a residential area, so maybe it's a local business like a convenience store, a service provider, or perhaps a government office? Wait, the review mentions \"controlled by ruling govt for propaganda purpose.\" That sounds like it might be a government-related business, but I'm not sure. Let's hold that thought.\n",

But the user is complaining about the business's practices, which could be relevant to the category. Wait, the business category isn't clear yet.

The review is about the business's practices, which could be relevant. But if the business is not a government entity, then this might be Irrelevant. But since the user is using terms like \"taxpayer money\" and \"ruling govt,\" it's possible the business is government-related. Therefore, the review is discussing the business's operations, which is relevant. However, the review might be a fake or satire. Wait, the user is giving a 1-star rating, which is low, but the content is critical. But the guidelines don't mention political bias as a filter.

The user might be a genuine customer, but the content is critical. However, the review doesn't have any of the spam or advertisement indicators. So the safest bet is to label it as Valid unless there's a clear reason to think it's another category. Alternatively, if the business is not government-related, then the review is Irrelevant. But since I can't confirm the business type, I have to go with the available info. The review is about the business's practices, so it's relevant. Therefore, the label would be Valid.

            "\n",
            "First, I need to check the categories. Let's start with the Advertisement category. The heuristics for Advertisement include having a URL, phone number, email, QR codes, or promotional words like \"discount,\" \"deal,\" \"offer,\" etc. The review has a cryptocurrency address, which is similar to a wallet address. While it's not a traditional URL or phone number, it's a form of contact information. Also, the phrase \"Please donate\" could be seen as a promotional request. However, the main content is about the hotel being sad, which is a negative review. But the donation part might be considered an advertisement if it's promoting a donation. However, the main focus is on the hotel's quality, so maybe it's more about the review itself. Wait, the user's instruction says to check if the text includes promotional words. \"Donate\" is one of the words listed. So the presence of \"Please donate\" might trigger the Advertisement category. But the review is also a 1-star rating, which is a negative sentiment. However, the Advertisement category's example includes a URL and promotional words. So this might be an Advertisement. Alternatively, maybe it's Spam because the rating (1 star) doesn't match the sentiment. Wait, the review says \"Sad hotel\" which is negative, and the rating is 1 star, which matches. So the rating does match the sentiment. So that's not Spam. Then, the donation part could be an Advertisement. But the main content is a review. However, the presence of the donation request might be considered an Advertisement. Alternatively, maybe it's Irrelevant because the donation is unrelated to the hotel's service. Wait, the Irrelevant category is for topics unrelated to the business category. The donation is a request for money, which is not related to the hotel's service quality. So maybe Irrelevant? But the user is asking for a donation, which could be a form of promotion. Hmm. Let me check the heuristics again. For Advertisement, the text includes promotional words like \"donate\" and a cryptocurrency address. So that would fit the Advertisement category. But the main review is about the hotel being sad. However, the presence of the donation request might be considered an Advertisement. Alternatively, maybe it's Spam because of the random characters or excessive CAPS? The review text is \"Sad hotel\" and then the donation request. The text isn't full of random emojis or excessive CAPS. So maybe not Spam. The main issue is the donation part. So the Advertisement category applies here. Therefore, the label should be Advertisement.\n",

            "First, I need to understand the content. The reviewer mentions doing exercises (push-ups, pull-ups) and writing a freestyle, which is a type of rap or poetry. They also say the hotel looked like a \"hebs.\" Wait, \"hebs\" might be a typo or a slang term. Maybe they meant \"heaps\" or \"heaps\" as in a lot? Or perhaps it's a misspelling of \"habs\" or another word. Alternatively, \"hebs\" could be a reference to a specific term in French, but I'm not sure. \n",

            "2. **Spam**: The text isn't random emojis or excessive CAPS. It's a coherent sentence, though a bit odd. The user did some exercises and wrote a freestyle. The mention of the hotel looking like a hebs might be a typo, but it's not random characters. So maybe not Spam.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Irrelevant**: The review talks about the hotel's appearance, which is related to the business category (hotel). The mention of doing exercises and freestyle might be a bit off-topic, but the main point is about the hotel. However, the user is talking about their own activities (push-ups, freestyle) rather than the hotel's services. Wait, the hotel being like a hebs—maybe \"hebs\" is a typo for \"heaps\" (a lot), so the hotel looked like a lot of something? Or maybe \"hebs\" is a misspelling of \"habs\" (habits)? Not sure. But the main issue is whether the review is about the hotel's quality. If the user is saying the hotel looked like a hebs (maybe a typo for \"heaps\" or another term), that's a comment on the hotel's appearance, which is relevant. However, the part about doing push-ups and freestyle might be unrelated. But the user is combining their own activities with the hotel's appearance. It's a bit confusing. \n",
            "\n",
            "4. **No Visit**: The review doesn't mention phrases like \"never been\" or \"didn't go.\" The user is talking about their own actions, so it's possible they visited. \n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Valid**: If none of the other categories fit, it's Valid. The review is a bit odd, but it's not clearly spam, advertisement, irrelevant, or no visit. The user might be trying to say the hotel's environment was suitable for their activities, but the phrasing is unclear. However, since the main subject is the hotel, and the other parts are about their own actions, it's possible the review is valid. \n",
